# SFZ to HISE converter / translator application

This is a JavaScript app that reads and parses SFZ instruments (music sampler instrument files) and makes HISE samplemaps and JSON data objects. 

[HISE](https://www.hise.audio/) is an open source music application and plugin framework for making musical instrument/effect plugins in the VST / AU / RTAS or AAX formats. This application converts the SFZ format into HISE samplemaps and also extracts unsupported (HISE wise) but useful SFZ opcode data and outputs it for easy use in your scripting work for your own musical instrument making. The output is in JSON object form and works in HISE (HISE-script) or any other programming language you might like to use. Read more in the manual, below.
